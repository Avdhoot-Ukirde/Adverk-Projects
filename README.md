# Minor-Project-1

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) using numpy, pandas and matplotlib and seaborn(if required) for the below Create a lot of visualisations, identify patterns on the data based on the survived column, Age column, Fare column, Gender Column, etc. Summarise the findings from the analysis.

# Minor Project 2:

Download the necessary images from google and use the Haar cascade algorithms to
perform detection of any of the following objects(Minimum 3).
-Eye
-Face
-Smile
-Eye Glasses
-Number plate

# Major Project:

Build Machine Learning model(classification) for the fruits dataset listed below
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjamilmoughal/fruits-with-colors-dataset
1. Do data ingestion (convert dataset into dataframe)
2. Do some preprocessing(if required), follow the steps for ML model creation.
3. Perform an extensive EDA.
4. Build multiple ML models(use different classification algorithms) and compare the
accuracies
5. Evaluate the model and write down the summarization of the process.
6. Create a streamlit app (optional).
